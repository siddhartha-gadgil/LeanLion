/-- A prime is a number larger than 1 with no trivial divisors -/
def IsPrime (n : Nat) :=
  1 < n ∧
    ∀ k, 1 < k → k < n → ¬ k ∣ n

/-- Every number larger than 1 has a prime factor -/
theorem exists_prime_factor :
    ∀ n, 1 < n → ∃ k, IsPrime k ∧ k ∣ n := by
  intro n h1
  -- Either `n` is prime...
  by_cases hprime : IsPrime n
  · grind [Nat.dvd_refl]
  -- ... or it has a non-trivial divisor with a prime factor
  · obtain ⟨k, _⟩ : ∃ k, 1 < k ∧ k < n ∧ k ∣ n := by
      simp_all [IsPrime]
    obtain ⟨p, _, _⟩ :=
      exists_prime_factor k (by grind)
    grind [Nat.dvd_trans]

/-- The factorial, defined recursively, with custom notation -/
def factorial : Nat → Nat
  | 0 => 1
  | n+1 => (n + 1) * factorial n
notation:10000 n "!" => factorial n

/-- The factorial is always positive -/
theorem factorial_pos : ∀ n, 0 < n ! := by
  intro n
  induction n
  · simp [factorial]
  · grind [factorial, Nat.mul_pos_iff_of_pos_left]

/-- ... and divided by its constituent factors -/
theorem dvd_factorial : ∀ n, ∀ k ≤ n, 0 < k → k ∣ n ! := by
  intro n; induction n <;>
    grind [Nat.dvd_mul_right, Nat.dvd_mul_left_of_dvd, factorial]

/--
We show that we find arbitrary large (and thus infinitely
many) prime numbers, by picking an arbitrary number `n`
and showing that `n! + 1` has a prime factor larger than `n`.
