## Quicksort Algorithm (Pivot from Head)

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm known for its efficiency. It works by recursively partitioning the list around a chosen element (pivot) and then sorting the sub-lists.

Our implementation of quicksort for lists follows the following steps:

* If the list is empty, return the empty list.
* Otherwise, let `pivot` be the first element (`head`) of the list.
* Let `smaller` be the list of elements smaller (`â‰¤`) than `pivot` and `larger` be the list of elements larger (`>`) than `pivot`.
* Recursively sort `smaller` and `larger` lists and concatenate them with `pivot` in between.
